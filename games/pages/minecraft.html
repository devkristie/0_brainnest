    <!-- Information about the game -->
    <p>Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language.</p>
    <h2>What the game is about</h2>
    <p>In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world with virtually infinite terrain and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and simple machines. Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode (in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health) and a creative mode (where players have unlimited resources and access to flight). Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.</p>
